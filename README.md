## DESCRIPTION:
My motive for this project is to become more efficent in web development/coding. Also to become proficent in understanding and using JavaScript.

## LEARNED/LEARNING:
I learned how to use falsy vaules, to make the code DRY by using an excalamation point in front of booleans. I also learn to keep the code DRY from repetitive prompts by defining a function and calling it. I learned how to add copy to clipboard option to a button element. As well as how to change a whole array to uppercase using  alpha.map(alpha => alpha.toUpperCase()). I also learned how to merge arrays using the .concat method. 

## PROCCESS/INSTALLTION:
First I psuedocoded comments to help plan out the Javascript file. Then I listed all possible variables I would need based on the psuedocode. I then created array variables for the character options. Then I defined the confirmLength variable with a prompt and if/if else/else statements which included lenght, lowercase, uppercase, special characters and number options. Before that finializing the confirm length variable I had to refactor the code, and test it a few times. During refactoring I made the copy button with copy to clipboard. Then I created a for loop along with Math.floor and Math.random, to create a random arrangement of characters and display the password. I finished with using .contact method to generate a password based on the user's inputs. Throughtout the whole process, I used console.log() and ChromeDevTools alot to ensure the code was working properly. 

## USAGE: 
![Generate Password](/assets/images/passGen.png)

Click the red, generate password button. The first prompt will ask what length you would like the password between 8 and 128 characters. Then you will be asked if you would like lowercase letters, uppercase letter, numbers and/or special characters included in the password. If you would like them included click ok, if not click cancel (you MUST include ONE character chose). When the password is generated, it will be shown in the dotted lined box. You can copy your password to your clipboard using the copy button. Or you can highlight it and use "command/ctrl + c" on your keyboard.
